  <h1>Recipe for Butter Chicken</h1>

  <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
  <p> Butter Chicken is probably one of the most popular Indian chicken recipes liked by all for its mild flavour and deliciously rich gravy. I would not be surprised if this is the most popular dish in Indian restaurants and so, this is a restaurant-style Butter Chicken Recipe.

     <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
         <ul>
            <li>350 grams boneless, skinless chicken breast or thigh cubed</li>
            <li>1 cup onions minced</li>
            <li>Three quarters cup tomato pureed</li>
            <li>1 tbsp canned tomato paste or sauce</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp butter or ghee</li>
            <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp minced ginger</li>
            <li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
            <li>1/2 to 1 tsp chilli powder use Kashmiri chilli powder for better colour and less heat</li>
            <li>1 tsp of garam masala</li>
            <li>1 large pinch of kasuri methi / dried fenugreek leaves</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of cream or pureed cashew paste soak and grind cashew nuts if using that</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp salt adjust to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 small bunch of coriander leaves / cilantro for ganish</li>
      <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
             <ol>
                <li>Heat the butter in a pan and add the minced onions. Fry until golden brown</li>
                <li>Add the ginger, garlic, coriander powder, chilli powder, turmeric, and salt</li>
                <li>Fry for a minute until fragrant</li>
                <li>Add the pureed tomato and tomato paste and cook for 3-4 mins until the mixture bubbles uniformly</li>
                <li>Add in the kasuri methi, milk, and the cubed chicken along with some salt</li>
                <li>Cook covered for 8-10 mins until the chicken is soft. The chicken will let out more water, just check once or twice in between and give the curry a stir. Keep the heat on low</li>
                <li>When the chicken is cooked soft, open the lid and cook for a further minute or two. If the gravy is too thick, add some water at this stage</li>
                <li>When done, add the garam masala and the cream or cashew paste. Give it a good stir, but don't boil</li>
                <li>Adjust salt, garnish with the coriander leaves, and remove from heat</li>
                <li>Serve hot with tawa naan, vegetable pulao, or jeera rice</li>
             </ol>      
            
            
         </ul>
